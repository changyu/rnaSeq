Rank Ordering of Super-Enhancers (ROSE) takes input BAM files from alignment and BED files from MACS and generates a ranked list of typical enhancers and super-enhancers. Output files include the ‘Plot_points.png’ file that demonstrates a ranked enhancer plot of the data, an ‘AllEnhancers.table.txt’ file that lists the chromosomal location of typical enhancers, ‘SuperEnhancers.table.txt’ that lists the location of super enhancers, ‘ENHANCER_TO_TOP_GENE.txt’ that predicts which gene the super-enhancer is associated with and a BED file that can be used to visualize super-enhancer regions on a genome browser.
